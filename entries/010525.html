        <h1>Meme Multiplication</h1>
        <p> Here's a <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@mr.pov272/video/7454982438012538158"> nifty video </a> showing two kids multiplying. One using the "standard" approach that I was taught in grade school, the other using some type of trick. The algorithm seems to be
        <h2> Multiply Two Two-Digit Number </h2>
        <p class="math-block"> 
            multiply a,b a>b, both being less than 100
            
            1) let c = 100-a
            2) let d = 100-b
            3) let e = 100*(a-d)
            4) let f = c*d
            5) e+f = ab 
            </p>
        <p> Does this work? It seems that it does, and we can quickly prove that it does </p>
        <p class="math-block">
            6) e = `100a-100d`
            7) e = `100a-100(100-b) = 100a-10000+100b`
            8) f = `(100-a)(100-b) = 10000-100a-100b+ab`
            9) e+f = `100a-10000+100b+10000-100a-100b+ab =ab `
            as required </p>
        <p> and we can generalize this to any base j and any exponent k </p>
        <p class="math-block">
        for a given base, j, let k be the smallest number such that `j^k > a`, then
        1) let `c = j^k-a`
        2) let `d = j^k-b`
        3) let `e = j^k(a-d)`
        4) let `f = c*d`
        hypothesis: `e+f = ab`
        5) `f = (j^k-a)(j^k-b) = j^(2k)-aj^k-bj^k+ab`
        6) `e = j^ka-j^kd = j^ka -j^k(j^k-b) = j^ka-j^(2k)+j^kb`
        7) `e+f = aj^k-j^(2k)+bj^k+j^(2k)-aj^k-bj^k+ab = ab`, as required. <p>
        <p> This is an interesting approach, but really only practical when a and b are close to 10^n. For example, multiplying 27 and 13 using this technique reduces to multiplying 73 by 87. Though in that case, the above approach could work. </p>
