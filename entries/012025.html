        <h1>Infinite Pythagorean Triples</h1>
        <p>
A pythagorean triple is relation between three natural numbers, `a,b,c` such that `a^2+b^2=c^2`.  the first such triple is `3,4,5: 9+16=25`
</p> <br>
<p> The question naturally arises, are there infitelyn many such triples? The answer is yes, in two ways. </p><br>
<p> The first, trivial way, is to note that each triple corresponds to a right triangle, so for each similar triangle the relation will hold; i.e. `3,4,5: 6,8,10 -> 36+64=100`.  Since there are infinitely many such triangles, there are infinitely many such triples. </p><br>
