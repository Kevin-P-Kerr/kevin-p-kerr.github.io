        <h1>Infinite Pythagorean Triples</h1>
        <p>
A pythagorean triple is relation between three natural numbers, `a,b,c` such that `a^2+b^2=c^2`.  the first such triple is `3,4,5: 9+16=25`
</p> <br>
<p> The question naturally arises, are there infitelyn many such triples? The answer is yes, in two ways. </p><br>
<p> The first, trivial way, is to note that each triple corresponds to a right triangle, so for each similar triangle the relation will hold; i.e. `3,4,5: 6,8,10 -> 36+64=100`.  Since there are infinitely many such triangles, there are infinitely many such triples. </p><br>
<p> But let's define a "primitive" pythagorean triple as follows: if `a` is coprime to `b` then `a,b,c,` is a primitive triple. So `3,4,5` is one such triple, `5,12,13` another.  This leads to two questions: (a) if `a` and `b` are coprime, is `c` coprime to both `a` and `b` as well? (b) are there infinitely many such triples? We will deal with (b) for now. </p> <br>
<p> If `a^2 + b^2 = c^2` then clearly `a^2 = c^2-b^2 = (c-b)(c+b)` We will use this fact to create a method for creating arbitrary primitive pythagorean triples. Since the arguments to this method will be infinite, this method will imply the existence of infinitely many such triples.  
<p class="math-block">
Let `a` be some square. Then we wish to write `a` as `(c+b)(c-b)` for some c,b.  There are two ways to do this.
First, if the number is odd, there are two numbers `c,b` such that `c+b=a` and `c-b=1`.  Then clearly `(c+b)(c-b) = a*1`, as desired. 
So, for example, `25=(13-12)(13+12)` and `5,12,13` is a pythagorean triple. 
Since `c,b` are simply the ceiling and floor of `a/2` respectively,
`c=2f+1` for some f
and `b=2f` for that same f
therefore, c and b are coprime. 
and, since, c and b are coprime, their sum is coprime to each, and their difference is coprime to each (though the sum and difference might not be coprime to eachother)
Therefore, the product `(c-b)(c+b)` is coprime to c and b, but that is equal to `a`, so the square rooot of `a` is also coprime to c and b.
Therefore, the triple describes by this method is primitive. 
Also, there are infinitely many such triples since there are infinitely many odd squares. 
</p>
On the otherhand, if `a` is even and greater than `4`, then  `a=2*n` for some n.  We can then use a technique similar to <a href="./011125.html"> to factor that number</a> For example, `16=8*2=(5+3)(5-3)` and `4,3,5` is a pythagorean triple.  I am not sure if this technique will always produce a primitive triple however.
