        <h1>Sum of Spreads In a Right Triangle</h1>
        In rational trigonometry, the spread between two lines takes the place of the notion of an angle in the usual or real-numbered trigonometry.  We can define the spread between two lines thus: Let lines AB and CB be two lines which intersect at B.  From some point D on AB draw a line to E on CB, such that DE is perpendicular to CB.  Then `(BD^2)/(BE^2)` is the spread between AB and CB.

        <br>For example, suppose the diagram above gives a 3,4,5 triangle, such that 
        <br>`a=3`<br>
        `b=4` <br>
        `c=5` <br>
        Then, `sBAC = x^2/a^2` and `sACB = x^2/b^2`<br>
        Now, we have `x^2 + (c-s)^2 = a^2` and `x^2 + s^2 = b^2` <br>
        Since `b>a` we can subtract the latter from the former, getting <br>
        `s^2 - (c-s)^2 = b^2-a^2`, or <br>
        `2cs -s^2 = 7` <br>
        Again, we know that `c=5`, so 
        `10s = 32` <br>
        `s = 32/10` <br>
        again, since `b=4` <br>
        `x^2 + 1024/100 = 16`, `x^2 = 576/100 = 144/25`
        <br> therefore, `sBAC = 144/225` and `sACB = 144/400` <br>
        Interestingly, these sum to 1. The question naturally arises, do these two spreads in a right triangle always sum to 1? They do. <br>
        Recall that `sBAC = x^2/a^2` and `sACB = x^2/b^2`, and therefore `sBAC + sACB = (a^2x^2 + b^2x^2)/(a^2b^2)`
        <br> therefore `sBAC + sACB = (x^2(a^2+b^2))/(a^2b^2) = (x^2c^2)/(a^2b^2)` <br>
        Then `sBAC + sACB = 1` iff `(x^2c^2) = (a^2b^2)` <br>
        Now `x^2 + (c-s)^2 = a^2` <br>
        `x^2 + s^2 = b^2` <br>
        `(c-s)^2 - b^2 = a^2 - b^2` <br>
        `c^2 - 2sc = a^2 - b^2` <br>
        `a^2 + b^2 - 2sc = a^2 - b^2` <br>
        `-2sc = -2b^2` <br>
        `-sc = -b^2` <br><br>
        `sc = b^2` <br><br>
        `s = b^2/c` <br><br>
        Then, having found s, and recalling `x^2 + s^2 = b^2` <br>
        `x^2 + (b^2/c)^2 = b^2` <br><br>
        `x^2 + b^4/c^2 = b^2` <br><br>
        `x^2 = b^2 - b^4/c^2` <br><br>
        `x^2 = (b^2c^2 - b^4)/(c^2)` <br><br>
        `x^2 = (b^2(c^2-b^2))/c^2` <br><br>
        `x^2 = (b^2(a^2+b^2-b^2))/c^2` <br><br>
        `x^2 = (b^2a^2)/c^2` <br><br> and multiplying both sides by `c^2` gives <br>
        `x^2c^2 = b^2a^2`, as required.
