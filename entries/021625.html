    <h1> Hex-Odd Numbers </h1>
    As we all know, odd numbers are those not divisible by 2. That is, all odd numbers can be expressed in the form of `2*n+1`.  <br>
    But what of all numbers that are relatively prime to both 2 and 3?  This is clearly a subset of the odd numbers. In fact, they take the form of `5+6*p` and `7+6*p` for some p.  <br>
    Theorem:  All positive integers greater than 1 are either even, a multiple of 3, or take the form of `5+6*p` or `7+6*p` for some p. <br>
    Proof: <br>
    Clearly 2,3,4,5,6,7 are all either even, multiples of 3 (3), or take the form `5+6*p` or `7+6*p`, namely, when p is 0. <br>
    Suppose `n>7`.  It is either coprime to six or not.  If not, then it has either 2 or 3 as a factor, and is therefore either even or a multiple of 3.  Suppose n is coprime to 6.  Then it is neither even nor a multiple of 3. <br>
    By the definition of mod, we know that there is some a,b such that `a+6*b=n`, where `a<6`. <br>
    Now, `a!=2` and `a!=3`, or else n would not be coprime to 6, as we suppose.  Therefore, `a=5` or `a=1`. <br>
    If `a=1` then subtract 6 from p and add it to a, to get `7+6b=n` for `b=n-1`.  <br>
    Therefore, for any number greater than 1, it is either even, or a multiple of 3, or can be expressed either by `5+6*p` or `7+6*p` for some p.
