    <h1> Hex-Odd Numbers </h1>
    As we all know, odd numbers are those not divisible by 2. That is, all odd numbers can be expressed in the form of `2*n+1`.  <br>
    But what of all numbers that are relatively prime to both 2 and 3?  This is clearly a subset of the odd numbers. In fact, they take the form of `5+6*p` and `7+6*p` for some p.  <br>
    Theorem:  All positive integers greater than 1 are either even, a multiple of 3, or take the form of `5+6*p` or `7+6*p` for some p. <br>
    Proof: <br>
    Consider the set of numbers (2,3,4,5,6,7)--now 2,4,6 and are even. 3 is a multiple of 3. and `5=5+6*0` and `7=7+6*0`.<br>
    Then consider the number the set of numbers n to `n+5`, such that n-1 is an odd multiple of 7. Then n, `n+2`, and `n+4` are even. <br>
