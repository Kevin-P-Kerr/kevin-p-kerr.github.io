        <h1>Some Simple Theorems About Numbers</h1>
        <h3> 1. The Sum of Coprime Numbers is Coprime to Both </h3>
            Let m,n be two coprime numbers, and let `q=m+n`<br>
            Suppose `q=p*m` for some p. Then `p*m=m+n` and `n=p*m-m=m(p-q)` which violates our hypothesis. And similar reasoning applies to n.
        <h3> 2. The Difference of Coprime Numbers is Coprime to Both </h3>
        let m,n be the two numbers and in question, and let `p=n-n`<br>
        let `d=m-n`. Then `d>=1`. Suppose `d>1`, then hypothesis says that d is coprime to both m and n. <br>
        Suppose this is not so. Then `d=p*m` or `d=p*n` for some p.  Say that `d=p*m`.<br>
        Then `m-n=p*m` and `p*m-m-n=0` and `p*m-m=n` and `m(p-1)=n.` which violates our hypothesis. and similar reasoning applies to m.
        <h3> 3. Adjacent Numbers Are Coprime </h3>
        Let m,n be adjacent numbers, that is, `m-n=1`. Then m and n are coprime. <br>
        For suppose they are not. Then `m=p*n` and `p*n-n=1`. <br>
        Then `n(p-1)=1`, which has no integer solution, and is therefore absurd--i.e. violates our hypothesis. 
        <h3> 4. Of Two Coprime Numbers, the Lesser can Be Added Either to 1 or to a Number Coprime to Both to Produce the Greater </h3>
        Let m,n be the coprime numbers, with `m>n`. Then there is a p coprime to m and n such that `p+n=m`.
        If the two numbers are adjacent, the `p=1`, but say they are not adjacent. <br>
        Let `d=m-n`, then d is coprime to m and n by (2) above, and `d+n=m`
