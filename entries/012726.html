        <h1>Solving (More) Linear Equations</h1>
        <a href="012526.html"> Last time </a> we found a general method for finding integer solutions of linear diophantine equations of two variables.  But say there three variables--what then? Let's try working out an example. <br>
        `10x+3y+7z=43` <br>
        First, we can rewrite this as <br>
        `10x+b=43`, and solve that for
        `x=4+m` and `b=3-10m`, then <br>
        `3y+7z=3-10m`, solving first for y we find <br><br>
        `y=1-3m-2z+(-m-z)/3` <br>
        setting `d=(-m-z)/3`, we get `3d=-m-z`<br>
        so that <br>
        `y=1-m-7d` <br>
        `z=-3d-m` <br>
        `x=4+m`, which gives us the general form which any integer solution will take. Finding positive integer solutons is more difficult and won't be dealt with in this post. <br>
        This suggest a few things. <br>
        1st, there should be a general procedure for computing integer solutions to linear diophantine equations of arbitrary unknowns, when this is possible. <br>
        2nd, letting N be the number of unknowns in the given equation, the form in which the various unknowns will be expressed will range over (N-1) variables.  Let's deal with each in turn.
        <h2> The Procedure </h2>
        Whereas in the previous installment, when dealing with the equations Ax+By=C, we checked that A and B were coprime, we can actually use a somewhat more flexible condition here. <br>
        Again, let Ax+By=C, then there are integer solutions iff g divides C, where `g=gcd(A,B)`. <br>
        Given that stipulation, we next calculate b,c,s where s=C/g and b,c are the smallest variables such that Ab+Bc=g (in practice, we can get these for free from the extended euclidean algorithm for calcuating g). <br>
        Then `x=sb+B/g` and `y=sc-A/g` <br>
        Then `Ax = Asb+AB/g` and `By = Bsc -BA/g` <br>
        `Ax+By=Asb+Bsc` and `Ax+By=s(Ab+Bc)` <br>
        Recalling that `s=C/g` we see that <br>
        `Ax+By=(C/g)(Ab+Bc) = C` <br>
        Having solved the base case, we can recurrently solve equations of more than two unknowns, by propagating the constraints from subsequent calls
        ```
        function solve(u,c) { //unknowns and c
            if (u.legnth < 2) { return error;}
            if (u.length == 2) { 
                solve base case
            }
            head = u[0];
            rest = u.cdr
            s = solve(rest,c)
            return s/head.coeff
        }
        ```
