        <h1>Meme Multiplication</h1>
        <p> Here's a <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@mr.pov272/video/7454982438012538158"> nifty video </a> showing two kids multiplying. One using the "standard" approach that I was taught in grade school, the other using some type of trick. The algorithm seems to be
        <h2> Multiply Two Two-Digit Number </h2>
        <p class="math-block"> 
            multiply a,b a>b, both being less than 100
            
            1) let c = 100-a
            2) let d = 100-b
            3) let e = 100*(a-d)
            4) let f = c*d
            5) e+f = ab
            </p>
        <p> Does this work? It seems that it does, and we can quickly prove that it does </p>
        <p class="math-block">
            6) e = 100a-100d
            7) e = 100a-100(100-b) = 100a-10000+100b
            8) f = (100-a)(100-b) = 10000-100a-100b+ab
            9) e+f = 100a-10000+100b+10000-100a-100b+ab =ab
            as required </p>
        <p> and we can generalize this to any base j and any exponent k </p>
        <p class="math-block">
        for a given base, j, let k be the smallest number such that j^k > a, then
