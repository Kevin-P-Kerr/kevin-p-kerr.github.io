        <h1>Rhine Papyrus Problem 40</h1>
        100 loaves of bread are to be divided among five men. The men's five shares of bread are to be in arithmetic progression, so that consecutive shares always differ by a fixed difference, or 
Δ  Furthermore, the sum of the three largest shares is to be equal to seven times the sum of the two smallest shares. Find 
Δ  and write it as an Egyptian fraction.
        <h2> The Solution </h2>
        <p> Say that x is the amount of bread given to the man with the least bread, and d is the "fixed difference" between them. Then
        <br>(1) <p class="math-block">
        x + (d + x) + (2d + x) +...+(4d + x) = 100
        <p> Then, " the sum of the three largest shares is to be equal to seven times the sum of the two smallest shares" </p>
        <p class="math-block">
        (4d+x)+(3d+x)+(2d+x) = 7(x+d+x),
        9d+3x = 14x+7d
        9d = 11x+7d
        2d = 11x
        d = 11x/2
        </p><p> Now we can use our definition of d in terms of x to solve for x.
        <p class="math-block">
        5x+10*(11x/2) = 100
        5x+55x = 100
        60x = 100
        x = 100/60
        x = 5/3
        d = 55/6
        </p>
