        <h1>9 Chapters on Mathematical Art: Preface 1</h1>
        <p> <blockquote> 昔在庖牺氏始画八卦，以通神明之德，以类万物之情，作九九之术，以合六爻之变。 </blockquote>
        I would translate the first two phrases as <blockquote> In antiquity, Paoxi Shi began to draw the bagua in order to know the power of the divine. </blockquote>
        Paoxi Shi (庖牺氏), as wikipedia says, is FuXi, the legendary consurt of NuWa and creator of the bagua.  The bagua being the 8 basic trigrams from which the 64 hexagrams of the yijing are built.  "Divine" translates shenming (神明), literally bright gods, who posses "de" 德--virtue or power.  This is the same 德 as we see in the "dao de jing"--the classic on the "power" of the dao.  <br>
        The next phrase is a bit harder. A slightly awkward translation might be 
        <blockquote> In order to classify the properties of all things </blockquote> qing 情 being the difficult word here--the scm says <blockquote> in early texts usually refers to the prevailing conditions of a subject </blockquote> the subject here being wanwu --everything. <br> The next phrase brings us our first piece of mathematics.  Zuo, 作, can mean either "to put into effect" or "to devise", and jiujiuzhishu is an algorithm for multiplication--"the nine nine multiplciation procedure", which we can surmise Paoxi Shi devised inorder to liuyao zhi bian (六爻之变) -- which is something to do with the bagua. But what is this "nine-nine" algorithm for multiplication, and what is liuyao zhi bian? <br>
        <p> Apparently, the nine-nine is both a multiplication table (1-9x1-9) as well as a song used for memorizing it.  But what the "procedure" is referred to is unclear--obviously one could look up entris in such a table just as school children might do today with our 10x10 table. The Hanyu Da Cidian says  <blockquote> 算术乘法名。以一至九每二数顺序相乘。上古时系由九九自上而下, 而至一一, 故称“九九乘法”。 </blockquote> 
        This is a little obscure to me. The first sentence is <blockquote> A name for multiplication. By which 1 to 9 each 2 numbers are in sequence multiplied In ancient times a system was used of 99 from top to bottom, so that one followed after the other, hence the name. </blockquote> This sounds like either a description of a multiplication table or of a procedure for using one.  In either case, I think this is clear enough. <br>
        This bring us to the last phrase.  "in order to unite the 六爻之变"  六爻 - is the general term for a hexagram from the book of changes--and bian means change.  As I recall from from my Wilhelm/Baynes translation of the I Ching, hexagrams, over the course of divination, can change depending on how the coins fall/yarrow stalks split.  That is, they can change via one of the lines in either bagua "breaking" or "uniting". However, it seems that the yarrow stalk procedure simply involves addition.  At any rate, another translation I consult simplys says that the multiplication procedure was devised to "complement" the hexagrams.  <br> </p>
<p> Next we have  <blockquote> 暨于黄帝神而化之，引而伸之，于是建历纪，恊律吕，用稽道原，然后两仪四象精微之气可得而效焉。记称“隶首作数”，其详未之闻也。 </blockquote> <blockquote> At the time of the divine yellow emperor it was extended, the result of which was the calendar cycle. Equally (恊-- which the hdc says is equivalent to tong同--he created the lulu (a type of flute), by means of which he reached the origin of the way (dao). Afterwards, (by) the two principles and four divisions, profound and subtle knoweledge of qi and it's power was able to be emulated.</blockquote>
