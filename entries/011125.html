        <h1>Fermat's Factorization Method</h1>
        <p> Fermat tells us that, since every odd composite is the difference of two squares, we can factor any such number the following way. For example, `55=(8+3)(8-3)` </p> <br> <p class="math-block">
        let y be the odd composite we wish to factor (assuming y is not a square). 
        then find a square x such that `x+y=z`, where z is also square
        then let j,k be the roots of those squares respectively
        then `(k+j)(k-j)= k^2 - j^2 = z-x = y`,
        therefore `(k+j), (k-j)` are factors of y. </p><br>
        <p> But how do we know that every off composite is the difference of two squares? Consider the following </p><br>
        <p class="math-block">
            If y is a non-square odd composite, then `j*k=y`, and j and k are odd. Let `j>k`.
            If j and k are odd, then `j+k` and `j-k` are even, and the midpoint between j and k, `(j+k)/2` is a whole number.
            Furthermore, the difference between the midpoint and either factor is `(j-k)/2`, which is also a whole number.
            Call the midpoint a, and the difference between the midpoint and the two factors b.
            Then `j=(a+b)` and `k=(a-b)`,
            `jk=(a+b)(a-b)=a^2-b^2=y`, as required.
        <p> As a bonus, here is a graph of the odd composites (x axis), mod the lesser root (y axis) </p><br>
